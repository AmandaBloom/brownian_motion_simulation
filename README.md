## how to basic:
1. window manipulation:
    ```pyqt5-tools.exe designer```
2. do smth then save file in designer to .ui file
    DO NOT CONVERT IN THIS GUI BCZ ITS BROKEN
3. instead convert the .ui use the command
    ```pyuic5.exe .\window.ui -o window_ui.py```
4. file window_ui.py is now QT converted to python code
5. DO NOT EDIT OUTPUT FILE BCZ IT MAY BE DELETED WHEN RECOMPILING .ui file
6. you may edit test_okna.py file to change application behavior
7. my honda eats through oil like Kononowicz
